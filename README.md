# Project-Database-Facial

Introduction 
    We implemented facial recognition for room access to prevent key card sharing, lost cards, and the inconvenience of passwords. However, without a strong facial database, accuracy and efficiency may be compromised.

    This project focuses on developing facial database for storing facial images along with identity details and multiple facial angles  to enhance accuracy. The scope is limited to data storage and management, excluding facial recognition model development.
